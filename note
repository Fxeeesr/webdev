Problem 1. The population of a city increases at a rate proportional to the present number. It has an initial
population of 50000 that increases by 15% in 10 years. What will be the population in 30 years?

The rate at which a super computer body cools is proportional to the difference between the
temperatureof the body and that of the surrounding air. If a body in air at 30°C will cool from
100° to 70° in one minute, find its temperature at the end of four minutes.


Problem 2. The rate at which a supercomputer body cools is proportional to the difference between the
temperature of the body and that of the surrounding air. If a body in air at 25°C will cool from
100°C to 75°C in one minute, find its temperature at the end of three minutes.

A bacteria culture is known to grow at a rate proportional to the amount present. After one hour, 1000 strands of the bacteria are observed in the culture; and after four hours, 3000 strands. Find (a) an expression for the approximate number of strands of the bacteria present in the culture at any time t and (b) the approximate number of strands of the bacteria originally in the culture.

A bacteria culture is known to grow at a rate proportional to the amount present. After one
hour, 1500 strands of the bacteria are observed in the culture; and after three hour, 3800
strands. Find the approximate number of strands of the bacteria originally in the culture.
